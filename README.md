# eventTracking
Scripts to process and analyse event-based precipitation data created by the Forward-in-time tracking algorithm (Skok et al. 2012)

These scripts are work in progress, and not all of them are currently working. Feel free to copy parts or all of the code, but you should implement your own checks to ensure the code works as you expect.

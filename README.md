# eventTracking
Scripts to process and analyse event-based precipitation data created by the Forward-in-time tracking algorithm (Skok et al. 2012)

These scripts are work in progress. To my knowledge they should all work given the right input files, which you can find on my webpage at http://atmos.washington.edu/~rachel/precipevents.html . Feel free to copy parts or all of the code, but you should implement your own checks to ensure the code works as you expect. Please let me know of any bugs you find.
